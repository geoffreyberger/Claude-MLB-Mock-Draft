  { pick:1, round:"R1", top:true,
    name:"Roch Cholowsky", school:"UCLA", type:"COL", pos:"SS", posClass:"IF", team:"Chicago White Sox",
    writeup:`<p>The consensus No. 1 overall pick and arguably the most clear-cut first-overall candidate since Adley Rutschman in 2019. The 6'2", 202-pound Chandler, Arizona native starred as a high school quarterback before arriving at UCLA and immediately taking over. As a sophomore in 2025, Cholowsky led <em>all of Division I in WAR</em>, batting .353/.480/.710 with 23 HR and 74 RBI — the most home runs by a Bruin since 2000. He earned Big Ten Player of the Year, Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, and the Brooks Wallace Award as the nation's top college shortstop. Baseball America describes "a simple setup in the box and a smooth, rhythmic swing" with an "advanced feel to hit to go along with a professional approach and sound pitch recognition." His 90% in-zone contact rate, 91.5 mph average exit velocity and 106.5 mph 90th-percentile exit velocity underscore the elite contact-plus-power blend.</p><p>Defensively, he grades as a plus shortstop with buttery-smooth actions, an advanced internal clock, and a strong, accurate arm that he can deliver from multiple angles. He opened 2026 with a .438/.500/1.188 slash line through four games, including a 108 mph grand slam off TCU pitching. MLB Pipeline's Jim Callis called him "a no-doubt shortstop with four plus tools, average speed and a high baseball IQ... the most well-rounded college player at his position since Troy Tulowitzki in 2005." The only blemishes on an otherwise spotless résumé are two underwhelming summers at the Cape Cod League (2024) and with Team USA (2025), and a 274-point OPS gap between Big Ten and non-conference opponents — though even against Big Ten pitching his OPS was still above 1.000.</p>`,

  { pick:2, round:"R1", top:true,
    name:"Grady Emerson", school:"Fort Worth Christian HS (TX)", type:"HS", pos:"SS", posClass:"IF", team:"Tampa Bay Rays",
    writeup:`<p>Emerson has been the consensus top prep prospect in the 2026 class for as long as anyone can remember. He transferred to Fort Worth Christian in North Richland Hills, Texas for his senior season after starring at Argyle High. The 6'2", lefty-hitting Texas shortstop checks every box teams prioritize near the top of a draft: a lengthy performance track record, advanced soft skills, and exactly the age (18.4 on draft day) that teams covet. Baseball America describes "an extremely balanced and repeatable swing" with "very little movement with his hands in the pre-pitch load" and "an incredibly steady head throughout the swing" — the kind of simplicity and repeatability that translates across levels. ESPN's Kiley McDaniel notes some scouts project him as a "plus to plus-plus hitter with plus power that sticks at shortstop long-term," enough to make him the No. 1 pick if Cholowsky hiccups at any point this spring.</p><p>This past summer, Emerson became the first USA Baseball player ever to play for two 18U national teams and two 15U national teams, helping lead the 2025 18U national team to a gold medal as the lineup's leadoff hitter. MLB Pipeline's High School All-Prospect Team praised him as someone who "does everything well on the field, with an advanced gameplan at the plate and the ability to make all the plays at short." He is next in a proud line of elite Dallas-area prep shortstops: Bobby Witt Jr. (2019, Pick 2), Jordan Lawlar (2021, Pick 6), and Jett Williams (2022, Pick 14). The only real criticism is that he lacks the flashy, plus-plus electric tools of a Witt or Bryce Harper at the same stage — but McDaniel notes that's "an incredibly high bar to clear."</p>`,

  { pick:3, round:"R1", top:true,
    name:"Justin Lebron", school:"Alabama", type:"COL", pos:"SS", posClass:"IF", team:"Minnesota Twins",
    writeup:`<p>Once the frontrunner for No. 1 overall before Roch Cholowsky's monster sophomore campaign, Lebron remains one of the most complete and projectable players in the class. The Archbishop McCarthy (FL) product came to Tuscaloosa as a relative unknown — originally committed to Rice before a strong fall wood-bat tournament prompted Alabama to offer. In two collegiate seasons, he posted a .327/.427/.593 career slash line with 30 HR, 27 doubles, and 24 stolen bases in 116 games. His sophomore line of .316/.421/.636 ranked second in SEC RBI (72) and led the Tide in doubles, HR, stolen bases, total bases, and runs. His max exit velocity of 110.5 mph, 94th-percentile hard-hit rate, and 14% chase rate showcase a player with legitimate plus-plus power potential and professional plate discipline. He opened 2026 with two HR in his first three games without a single strikeout.</p><p>Defensively, he earned the All-SEC defensive team in back-to-back seasons, with outstanding lateral range, a plus arm, and the body control to make throws from all arm angles. On the bases, he went 17-for-18 (94%) on stolen base attempts in 2025. Baseball America describes his hit tool as the most variable element — "swing-and-miss tendencies against spin and soft stuff that were exploited more in conference play." His 24.2% strikeout rate is the primary flag, but Just Baseball summarizes the upside cleanly: "Lebron has a shot at having four tools with a 60 grade. That's going to be a high-impact player, regardless of some of the offensive warts." ESPN's McDaniel ranks him No. 3, noting some scouts' concerns about the hit tool have slipped him a spot or two from some teams' boards.</p>`,

  { pick:4, round:"R1", top:true,
    name:"Jackson Flora", school:"UC Santa Barbara", type:"COL", pos:"RHP", posClass:"P", team:"San Francisco Giants",
    writeup:`<p>The most electric arm in the draft class and a player rapidly climbing boards heading into spring. ESPN's McDaniel moved him to No. 4 overall in his first 2026 rankings, noting Flora "sat 96-99 and hit 100 mph with above-average shape/movement on the pitch, helped by almost 7 feet of extension; there's front-line potential if he continues like this and keeps throwing strikes." UCSB's Tyler Bremner went second overall in 2025; Flora has every chance to go higher. The 6'5" right-hander dominated his opening 2026 start over Southern Miss (6 IP, 0 R, 5 K) and then flashed his 70-grade fastball for 6 K's in 5 IP of one-run ball against Portland the following weekend. One scout told Baseball America: "You can draw some pretty clear lines between what he's capable of doing with a baseball to what some very big names in the sport right now are doing with a baseball... He has the potential to be a very high-end rotation piece."</p><p>This offseason, Flora added a kick changeup that Baseball America says "has scouts buzzing" and is already grading as a potential plus pitch. Combined with his sweeper — described as "one of the most dynamic breaking balls in the class" — a standard slider, and a mid-80s curve, he now features a deep four-pitch arsenal that MLB front offices crave. Federal Baseball's profile graded his fastball at 70 and noted he "only walked 2 batters per nine innings last season. That combination of stuff and command is the kind of thing that makes scouts drool." In 2025 he went 8-2 with a 3.60 ERA, 1.00 WHIP and 86 K in 75 IP. The knock is that UCSB doesn't face the strongest competition — but Sox Machine noted that even his C-game performance "still came with premium stuff."</p>`,

  { pick:5, round:"R1", top:true,
    name:"Drew Burress", school:"Georgia Tech", type:"COL", pos:"CF", posClass:"OF", team:"Pittsburgh Pirates",
    writeup:`<p>The top college position player in the class who isn't a shortstop. The 5'9" Georgia Tech center fielder is undersized and takes what scouts call "a healthy hack" at the plate — but the production is impossible to ignore. Burress smashed 9 HR in his first 8 career college games and went deep 44 times across two seasons, 10th most in Georgia Tech program history and already only 13 shy of the school record. His .756 career slugging percentage is the best in program history for any hitter with 300+ at-bats, narrowly ahead of Mark Teixeira's .712. In 2025 alone he led the ACC in extra-base hits (43) and doubles (23), posting a 1.162 OPS with 62 RBI. He walked 111 times against 79 strikeouts over two college seasons and made contact on 92% of fastballs he saw. He is one of only two underclassmen nationally to earn back-to-back first-team All-American honors (per D1Baseball).</p><p>ESPN's McDaniel ranks him No. 5, calling it "an advanced bat with more thump than you'd expect from a 5-foot-9 hitter" that "overshadows a package of at least solid tools across the board." Just Baseball's detailed board describes "explosive bat speed from the right side of the plate with an affinity for hammering fastballs" and "a polished hit tool with feel to lift to the pull side with authority." The swing has a large leg kick and some drift in the load that introduces timing risk against off-speed down-and-away, and the 5'9" frame limits projectability. But the batting line answers any doubts: his .756 career slugging percentage nearly half a point better than the Georgia Tech legend who followed him to the majors.</p>`,

  { pick:6, round:"R1",
    name:"Derek Curiel", school:"LSU", type:"COL", pos:"CF", posClass:"OF", team:"Kansas City Royals",
    writeup:`<p>The table-setter and leading hitter on LSU's 2025 national championship team, Curiel batted .345/.470/.519 with 20 doubles, 7 HR and 55 RBI in 68 games as a true freshman — the kind of freshman performance in the SEC that earns Christian Yelich comps, which is exactly what MLB.com's college all-prospect team gave him. Bleacher Report's winter big board ranks him No. 5 overall, citing his 60-grade hit tool as the best among all outfielders in the class. ESPN's McDaniel ranks him No. 6, noting "sometimes that combination [contact, medium power, center field] clicks quickly in pro ball and turns into someone like Mets OF Carson Benge."</p><p>Just Baseball's detailed scouting notes "a tranquil and rhythmic operation from the left side of the plate, staying in control throughout his load and consistently getting the bat to the baseball." He rarely whiffs, draws walks at a high clip, and uses the gaps effectively. The ceiling caveat is honest: "He doesn't have the bat speed and torque of his peers, which limits his overall ceiling" as a slugger. But his .470+ on-base percentage as an SEC freshman, a 60-grade hit tool, and a developing center field profile give him one of the most reliable offensive floors in the class. At 21.1 years old on draft day and a draft-eligible sophomore, he's one of the younger college players on the board.</p>`,

  { pick:7, round:"R1",
    name:"Cameron Flukey", school:"Coastal Carolina", type:"COL", pos:"RHP", posClass:"P", team:"Baltimore Orioles",
    writeup:`<p>Flukey burst onto the national stage in 2025, pitching Coastal Carolina to the College World Series finals — where the Chanticleers lost 1-0. His final season line was 8-2 with a 3.19 ERA, 1.003 WHIP and 118 strikeouts in 101.2 innings against just 24 walks. As a freshman in 2024 he fanned 83 hitters with only 27 walks despite a 5.73 ERA, establishing the strikeout-to-walk ratio that now defines his profile. ESPN's McDaniel ranks him No. 7, and Bleacher Report's mock had him as the first pitcher off the board. Just Baseball's college scouting board describes "an athletic delivery with a longer arm action, displaying significant scap loading" and a fastball now reaching 98-99 mph at peak "with much more intent" compared to his freshman year.</p><p>The strength of Flukey's case is the combination of his fastball-starter-traits pairing, which ESPN's McDaniel calls "among the best in the draft," and his proven ability to dominate over a full season workload. The weakness is that his breaking stuff grades as "fringy" and he doesn't often turn over the changeup. Sox Machine's opening-week report highlighted his first 2026 outing (5.2 IP, 2 ER, 1 BB, 7 K vs. Fairfield) but noted he missed his second start of 2026 in what the team characterized as a precautionary move unrelated to arm health. On3 reported Bleacher Report has him as "the first pitcher off the board" in their mock — that's the ceiling if the breaking stuff develops. That's why he goes here at 7.</p>`,

  { pick:8, round:"R1",
    name:"Gio Rojas", school:"Stoneman Douglas HS (FL)", type:"HS", pos:"LHP", posClass:"P", team:"Athletics",
    writeup:`<p>The consensus top prep arm in the 2026 class, a designation Rojas has held for most of the past two years. ESPN's McDaniel ranks him No. 8, and his description is telling: Rojas "is older for the class, but has four above-average pitches and has been a standout prospect for years, like Emerson." There is "some agreement in the industry that Rojas is the top prep arm" according to ESPN's prep pitching consensus. The 6'4", Miami commit brings a fastball up to 98 mph, a high-spin sweeping slider, a curveball, and a promising changeup from Parkland, Florida's storied Stoneman Douglas High School — the same program that produced Jordan Lawlar (2021, Pick 6).</p><p>He led Stoneman Douglas to a state championship and pitched for Team USA's 18U national team — both significant validations of his elite arm talent. MLB Pipeline's High School All-Prospect Team highlighted him as a top prep arm. The primary flag is his age — he is older for the prep class, which reduces projection but increases confidence in an already-advanced arsenal. Scouts who have tracked him through the entire showcase circuit consistently praise his strike-throwing and mound presence. His four-pitch mix is ahead of where most prep left-handers are at any age, and his Florida competitive environment means he has faced elite competition throughout his development.</p>`,

  { pick:9, round:"R1",
    name:"AJ Gracia", school:"Virginia", type:"COL", pos:"OF", posClass:"OF", team:"Atlanta Braves",
    writeup:`<p>A Duke transfer who arrived at Virginia for the 2026 season and immediately announced his presence — three home runs in his first game as a Cavalier. Over two seasons at Duke, Gracia posted a 1.003 OPS with 29 HR, more walks than strikeouts, and 112 RBI, establishing himself as one of the premier power bats in college baseball. ESPN's McDaniel ranks him No. 9 overall, noting his swing can get "uphill at times" and he "likely shifts to a corner outfield spot, but there's real offensive upside that keeps him up here." Bleacher Report's winter big board placed him at No. 11 overall. MLB.com's college all-prospect team included him with a 60-power grade.</p><p>His profile is a power-first, professional-approach outfielder — the kind of bat that can carry a lineup regardless of defensive home. The swing's upward tendency introduces risk against advanced breaking balls low-and-away, and limited arm strength likely profiles him in left field at the next level. But his walk rate and patience give him real on-base upside to complement the power, and his 29 HR over two Duke seasons back up the raw power grades with actual production against ACC competition. ESPN McDaniel's consensus for his group of nine: "The feedback I got from scouts was to keep these nine players so far in the top group in some order" — a clear acknowledgment of his legitimate first-round floor.</p>`,

ESPN's McDaniel mentions him among the prep shortstop pool beyond the top three (Emerson, Spangler, Maniscalco). His Stony Brook School (NY) background means he has faced less premier competition than Florida and Texas prep stars, but USA Baseball's selection process is rigorous enough that his inclusion carries real weight.</p><p>The defensive reputation is his calling card — scouts consistently describe his actions at short as among the best they've seen in the prep class, with exceptional instincts, hands, and footwork. The offensive profile is more developmental, with contact skills that evaluators project to improve as his frame fills out and he faces higher-quality pitching. For Arizona — a franchise that prizes up-the-middle defense and has successfully developed shortstops (Ketel Marte, Geraldo Perdomo) — Ruiz's defensive tools and shortstop ceiling make him an appealing competitive balance pick even acknowledging the offensive development required.</p>`,

  { pick:"CBA-4", round:"CBA",
    name:"Tegan Kuhns", school:"Tennessee", type:"COL", pos:"RHP", posClass:"P", team:"St. Louis Cardinals",
    writeup:`<p>Kuhns emerged as one of the draft's most prominent risers following a spectacular Cape Cod League summer in 2025: a 1.35 ERA and a 20-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 13.1 innings across three starts — one of the best Cape summers recorded by any 2026-eligible arm. Baseball America's preseason preview highlighted him. Sox Machine specifically named him as a pitcher capable of cracking the top 15 with a strong 2026 season. Bleacher Report's pitching board lists him No. 9 among all 2026 arms. He moved into a Friday starter role at Tennessee in 2026 on a loaded Volunteers pitching staff.</p><p>His command profile was inconsistent in a complementary 2025 college role, but the Cape performance suggested a different level when given regular extended opportunities. He brings a mid-90s fastball and a bat-missing slider, with scouts noting his stuff plays significantly better when fully stretched out as a starter rather than working in a limited leverage role. Tennessee's track record of sending arms to the draft at high value (Chase Dollander, No. 9 overall in 2024; Ben Joyce; Drew Beam) adds developmental credibility to his profile. For St. Louis — a franchise that has consistently developed SEC arms into major league contributors — Kuhns' rising stock and Tennessee pedigree make him a natural competitive balance target.</p>`,

  { pick:"CBA-5", round:"CBA",
    name:"Cole Young", school:"IMG Academy (FL)", type:"HS", pos:"SS", posClass:"IF", team:"Tampa Bay Rays",
    writeup:`<p>This pick was acquired from the Baltimore Orioles as part of the Shane Baz trade. An advanced prep shortstop out of IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida — one of the premier baseball development programs in the country — Young is praised for elite plate discipline and a mature, contact-first approach unusual for a high schooler. IMG Academy attracts elite prospects from across the nation and provides professional-caliber coaching and data that accelerates development timelines significantly. Multiple draft services list Young in the 25-35 overall range for his age-adjusted offensive feel and legitimate middle-infield defensive profile.</p><p>He's a left-handed bat with solid athleticism and the defensive actions to stick at shortstop long-term. His plate approach — walking at a high clip and making consistent contact — gives him a profile more similar to a polished college bat than a typical high schooler, which is the expected result of IMG Academy's program. For Tampa Bay — a franchise that has converted mid-round prep picks into productive big leaguers more consistently than any organization in baseball over the past decade — Young's combination of approach, athleticism, and shortstop tools make him an ideal competitive balance target. His selection here rewards the Rays for a strong organizational trade.</p>`,

  { pick:"CBA-6", round:"CBA",
    name:"Will Brick", school:"Christian Brothers HS (TN)", type:"HS", pos:"C", posClass:"C", team:"Pittsburgh Pirates",
    writeup:`<p>Bleacher Report's winter big board listed Brick at No. 31 overall, calling him "an astounding athlete with eye-opening metrics." MLB Pipeline's High School All-Prospect Team featured him as the top catcher in the class with this description: "A star for Team USA at the 18U World Cup, Brick then reclassified from 2027 to be a part of this class. He has real catch-and-throw skills to go along with a chance to hit for average with some thump." The Mississippi State commit reclassified from 2027 to join this class after his 18U World Cup performance, making his evaluation process significantly accelerated.</p><p>The 6'0", 200-pound right-handed hitter is one of the most complete prep catching prospects in recent memory. His framing, blocking, and plus arm strength all grade above-average, and his offensive profile — hit for average with emerging power — gives him a realistic shot at becoming an everyday catcher. Two-way catching prospects of his caliber and age (18.2 on draft day) are extraordinarily rare. For Pittsburgh — a franchise with a strong tradition of developing catchers and a clear organizational need for a catcher of the future — Brick's reclassification from 2027 represents exactly the kind of organizational prize that teams hunting in the competitive balance section dream of finding.</p>`,

    name:"Jensen Hirschkorn", school:"Kingsburg HS (CA)", type:"HS", pos:"RHP", posClass:"P", team:"New York Yankees",
    writeup:`<p>An LSU commit from Kingsburg, California — a small San Joaquin Valley town about 25 miles southeast of Fresno — who earns consistent placement in the No. 4-5 range among prep right-handers in the class. ESPN's McDaniel ranks him No. 29 overall. Bleacher Report's pitching board lists him No. 5 among all 2026 right-handers specifically. Multiple draft services, including Bleacher Report and MLB Pipeline, place him in the 25-35 overall range. He offers genuine starter upside and physical projection from a frame that scouts have specifically called out as one of the more projectible prep pitcher frames in the West.</p><p>Scouts who have seen him describe above-average velocity with room to add significantly more as his frame develops under LSU's program — or even before, if he signs and enters a professional development system. His LSU commitment adds developmental credibility — the Tigers have an extraordinary recent track record of developing prep right-handers (Paul Skenes, Ty Floyd, among others). The Kingsburg, CA background suggests he may be more accessible financially than premium Texas or Florida prep arms. For New York — a franchise aggressively developing young pitching arms and with the financial resources to outbid clubs for attractive prep pitchers — Hirschkorn's ceiling and projectability make him a natural competitive balance fit.</p>`,

  { pick:"CBA-8", round:"CBA",
    name:"Jacob Rudner", school:"North Carolina", type:"COL", pos:"RHP", posClass:"P", team:"Philadelphia Phillies",
    writeup:`<p>A North Carolina right-hander who brings an unusually cerebral approach to pitching. In 2026, he publicly spoke with the NCAA's national coordinator of umpires about Trackman pitch-tracking technology and its implications for how pitchers are evaluated — a level of analytical engagement with the craft that resonates strongly with modern front offices. Baseball America's draft coverage has noted him specifically in their college preview material. On the mound, he brings a mid-90s fastball and a bat-missing slider with above-average command, operating within one of the ACC's most respected pitching programs.</p><p>His analytical approach to pitching — understanding how pitches play against different hitter types, using data to optimize his attack plan, and engaging actively with technology — gives him a profile that analytically-driven front offices prioritize. His command is the standout attribute: he consistently throws quality strikes and forces hitters to make weak contact even when his pure velocity grades aren't at the top of the class. For Philadelphia — a franchise that has invested heavily in pitch development and analytics, turning Ranger Suárez and others into premium starters through development — Rudner's combination of competitive stuff and intellectual engagement with the craft make him a compelling competitive balance pick.</p>`,

    writeup:`<p>Colorado closes Competitive Balance Round A with an Oral Roberts right-hander who earned national recognition when MLB Pipeline featured him in a highlight reel in January 2026 — significant attention for an arm from outside the Power 4 spotlight. Willoughby is a power arm with a mid-90s fastball and a sharp breaking ball that have generated enough positive evaluations to land him on MLB Pipeline's radar and in the top-50 range of several draft services. Oral Roberts has a genuine tradition of producing professional-caliber pitching arms from a lower-profile setting, and Willoughby's metrics and stuff track in the right direction.</p><p>The mid-major background is simultaneously a challenge (weaker competition makes stuff grades harder to contextualize) and an opportunity (teams willing to look past conference prestige and focus on pure stuff can find tremendous value at this level). His 2026 non-conference schedule will be heavily scrutinized by scouts looking to validate his stuff grades against Power 4 competition. For Colorado — a franchise that desperately needs pitching depth at every level of the organization and has historically struggled to develop arms — Willoughby's combination of power stuff and projectable profile makes him an ideal swing pick at the final slot of Competitive Balance Round A.</p>`,
